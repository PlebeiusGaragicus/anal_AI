would it be more accurate to train this data by keeping the "from" or the "from_id" or both?  Example: "from": "Dan",
   "from_id": "user489729079",
The answer to this question depends on the specific use case and the goal of your machine learning model. Both the "from" and "from_id" fields could potentially be useful in training your model, depending on what you're trying to predict.

Here are a few factors to consider:

The "from" field is the human-readable name of the sender, while the "from_id" field is a unique identifier assigned by Telegram to the sender. Depending on the nature of your dataset and the type of predictions you're trying to make, you may find one or the other to be more informative.
The "from" field may be more useful if you're trying to predict something related to the sender's identity or behavior, such as their gender, age, or language proficiency. The "from_id" field may be more useful if you're trying to track the behavior of specific users over time, or if you need to link messages to a specific user in another database.
Including both fields in your training data could potentially help your model learn more complex relationships between senders and message content, such as patterns in the language used by users with specific names or IDs.
Ultimately, the decision of whether to include the "from" or "from_id" fields (or both) in your training data will depend on your specific use case and the nature of the predictions you're trying to make. You may need to experiment with different combinations of features to see which ones work best for your task.
