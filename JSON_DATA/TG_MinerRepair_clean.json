I have visited many farms where I scanned the shelves and seen hundreds of these fans go out and it's a domino effect of issues that cost miners more money vs just replacing the PSU fans.",

M20 is a rare model and we cant get new Power supplies for it. That power supply also has a model number called P11. So M20 gets the P11 PSU and M21S uses a PSU called P21. So the power supply does have some internal logic and a data cable which goes from it to the miner. What we are trying to do is use a P21 PSU with a M20 miner. So far what happens when we bolt them together we get an error code that a config file for P21 can not be found. Any ideas on how to best solve this issue? Can p11 firmware be flashed to a p21 PSU or have proper power config loaded onto an m20?"

In order to avoid future problems with suppliers and customers, I bring to your attention information on Bitmain ASICs, namely, 19 line.\nNumerous failures of devices have already been identified, sometimes even from boxes when first turned on, boards fall into short circuit.\nThe reasons are simple. In addition to the same low-melting solder, with components evaporating over time, for which S9k / S17 / T17 / S17 + / T17 + / S17e / T17e are famous, the engineers equipped the hash boards with heatsinks screwed directly to the PCB, apparently the properties of metals at different temperatures, Bitmain are unknown. But this is half the trouble, thermal paste is applied to the chips, which Bitmain economize for some reason, directly at the factory. Thermal grease can be squeezed out over time from heating, vibrations, and pressure, the radiators touch the power buses, which, in turn, are not completely covered with insulation, the board goes into a short circuit and fails.\nA way out of the situation.",

Or is it a must to put some additional detergent ? \n- is there off the shelf easy to find detergents to put in the water vs specialized liquids which are hard fo find and order only.\n- someone suggested acetone in small quantity ? Is that truly ok or is it dangerous ? If ok, what is the concentration ? \n- After ultrasound bath, do we need any additional steps to rinse in alcohol for example?\n- How much time and what temperature is optimal ?\n- How about drying ? Any tips on that ?\n- many people have a secret mix for cleaning, but really what is an off the shelf active ingredient thats safe to use and gets the job done.\nI have a 30 L ultrasound bath and are looking for best practice home garage cleaning tips.\nThanks !"

How do I know the serial number of hash boards belongs to my miner in question  without the video ? \n\n2) miner under 12 months warranty. Miner in Kazakhstan farm\nNow. Is it worth sending it to China Bitmain or getting it locally repaired better without going through Bitpain s (useless?) warranty and customs/transport issue and costs again ? - cost range estimates given for diagnostics n repair from 68$-389$."

The RO signal is 1,8 volt and is fine. The clk signal is fine till chip nummer 61, this is the first chip in the last voltage domain. The voltage of clk is 0 v on chips 61 and 1,8 v on chip 62 0v on chips 63 1,8 v on chip 64 and i am unsure on chips 65. I replaced al the 5 chips of the last voltage domain already but nothing helps.

Be aware that this firmware does cost you a percentage of parallel mining (for s17 i think its 2% but dont quote me on that) however its justified to me if i can tweak and get the additional chain going when i cant under antminer firmware. \nIf you have kept the s17+ up to date on firmware than the only way to flash the firmware to hiveon is with an sd card. \nYou download the zip archive for the firmware for your model (this is critical), unzip it onto the SD card root. Then power down your s17+, put in the sd card and plug it back in, it will take a couple minutes and then the green and red leds will flash together off and on to indicate flashing of firmware is complete. Power down the unit, remove the sd card and power back on. Flashing the firmware will result in a new DHCP address, so you will need to find it again. Then log into the miner with the new firmware, put in your pool info again.\nAt that point you will be able to tweak the asic performance on a whole unit level or individual chains and domains"

More than likely you need to use the dr5 SD firmware on bitmain website. You have corruption in your flash filesys, multiple possible causes including weird power surges etc but you need a nandwrite and flasheraseall -j to get clean markers for MTD mounts. Since we're working on a grey box model where you can't perform those functions or alter the erase_blocksize basically your ability to do this is to try the reset button and try to reflash with an sd image which normally performs a nandwrite and may resolve this. If neither of those options work you may have to replace the ctrlbd."

The uart isn t mandatory, it would just be helpful so I wouldn t have to bother you with rebooting or reflashing if something goes wrong. \n\nIf you have the ability to get me access to an online T2T controller, and you don t kind of the board happens to get damaged, please DM me.

Replaced fan again and realized it was running at extremely high rpms. \n\nI then powercycled the miner multiple times and each time it seemed to lower the rpm of the replaced fan. I did not reseat the cable as some here have suggested from my searches about this issue. \n\nI kept powercycling the miner about 10 times total until the replacement was running at similar RPMs to the other fans and have had no issues since then. I am not sure exactly what caused this issue but this has worked now with 2 different fan replacements that had this issue of running at extremely high rpms after replacing a dead fan. \n\nIf anyone knows why this issue occurs or how to prevent it I would be very interested"

To avoid more corrosion there are solutions such as a very thin layer of acrylic on the places at risk, obviously not on the asics themselves since the acrylic will act as a thermal insulator."

First, let me preface by saying that I am relatively new to the crypto world, but now, working for a hosting company, we keep encountering similar issues with warranty miners/parts. If a miner with a serial number that is in it's warranty period has a bad hash board, and the hash board is removed for us to realize the hash board serial number itself is NOT under warranty, how do you suggest we proceed with getting these items repaired? In the past it has been suggested that we tell our clients to reach out to their seller, so that the seller can contact Bitmain (if it's an AntMiner) to see if they can straighten out the mess of a SN part that is no longer under warranty if it came from a machine that IS under warranty. Any help would be awesome."

I switched the pool on 013 & 014 machines to the luxor pool to test. I also did a factory reset through the WTS tool and DISABLED fast boot. Without fast boot enabled, it takes the WTS about 20-25 minutes to reach full hash, BUT fast boot bypasses the \"tuning\" process in the chips (as far as I can tell). After doing all that, those two machines reached full hash within 25 minutes. \n\nI then suspected it wasn't the pool, but rather was the fast boot \"tuning\" bypass. So I disabled fast boot on the remaining 4 M30S+ machines and did not perform a factory reset. Just disabled fast boot and rebooted them. 25 minutes later and they are hashing correctly on viabtc.\n\nLater this week, I will re-enable fast boot and try them again. I suspect that once you allow them to do a \"slow boot\" then the machine will just return to those chip frequencies each time. \n\nAll in all I've invested about 3 hours in this process. I'm confident in my conclusions until proven otherwise. We'll know what to do better next time.\n\nThis isn't miner repair per SE, but definitely troubleshooting. If Amy of my assumptions are wrong, please correct me. I'm sharing this here to help another pleb and would appreciate any useful feedback."

To build an electronics system that cannot catch fire, you will need to use fire-resistant materials and components. Make sure to use a fire-resistant circuit board, and choose components that are designed to not catch fire easily. You may also want to consider using a fire-resistant coating on your electronics.\n2.  Make sure that your electronics are well-ventilated. Overheating is one of the main causes of fires in electronics, so good ventilation will help to keep your system cool and prevent fires.\n3.  Keep your electronics away from flammable materials. If possible, store your electronics in a fire-resistant safe or cabinet.\n4.  Regularly check your electronics for signs of wear and tear, and replace any damaged components immediately.\n5.  Have a fire extinguisher nearby in case of an emergency."

Some specific considerations for designing electrical systems in a vacuum include the following:\n-How will the system be powered? Possible options include solar panels, batteries, and fuel cells.\n-What type of insulation will be needed to protect the system from the harsh space environment?\n-What type of materials will be used for the electrical components? Metallized plastics and ceramics are often used in vacuum-rated electrical components.\n-How will the system be tested and verified to ensure it will function properly in a vacuum environment?"

When sending HB's out for repair, are there any key indicators when receiving them back (other than the hashboard's own serial number) that shows which machine it previously would have belonged to? Without getting too long-winded: I work for a hosting company, and prior to my hire, in the stages of infancy and predating an official logistics system where serial numbers were regularly recorded, they would send parts out in small enough quantities to easily allocate which machine a specific returned hash board belonged to. However, in the transition period, the quantities increased and we recently received some Hashboards back from repair that we can't seem to find machines for. Any help would be appreciated."

I didn't change anything else but I did remove/replace the bus bar screws and the cables to the PSU in the process. Temps are warmer outside so I know I'm not running as cool, but I was showing all 126 chips were good on all board for the last week or so. These ASICs have less than 2 weeks run time total."

Neither one would update.  Flashed an SD Card with Vnish's 88 chip version and miner hashes fine.  Customer wants to run on stock firmware, but I'm out of ideas.  Anyone have suggestions?

I would really appreciate it if you could help me.\n\nSo far, I have received several Hashbird Whatsminer models for repair, which have a common problem\n\nThe problem is that the hash board consumes a lot of amperage and heats up very quickly, and the clock signal is constantly having problems.\n\nFor example, a certain chip has a low clock signal, and I change that chip, but after testing and changing it After a few more chips, the same problem repeats itself, and all I can say is that the hashboard has a short circuit, but I can't find the exact location of the short circuit, and the hashboard problem goes from one place to another every time, and I'm confused.\n\nIs there a special way to find a short circuit and also fix such a problem?\nHave you ever encountered such a problem?"

What s the fastest / safest way to not get zapped from a PSU that might have juice stored up in a capacitor? \n\nThere should be a way to drain the high voltage caps after only taking the top of the power supply case off - clearly there s a way, because it s discharging thru people s fingers.\n\nWhich of the easily-accessible points from the top are actually connected to the capacitors? And, would touching those points together with a resistor do the job?\n\nIt seems that we d have to take the entire power supply apart to get to the high voltage caps from the bottom. We could discharge them that way, but it s not easy to get the bottom side of the PCB, unscrewed and flip it over, and drain the capacitor  before inadvertently getting shocked somewhere in the process, long before gaining access to the drain points underneath."

I have resold the machines and offered out hosting contracts to clients for these machines that begin on January 1st 2023. Is anyone able to help me get these machines running or at least review logs so that I can attempt to get them repaired? Is there a good place in the midwest that does repair of S19's?

When I was a video editor, visual effects artist and video engineer, even using the latest technology had me wait for 10 minutes after chopping up a sequence of the video. Sometimes it would even take an hour snd at 58 minutes the computer would crash and all that rendering would be lost.",
